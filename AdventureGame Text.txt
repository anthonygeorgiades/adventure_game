Assignment: Adventure GameName: Escaping La Catedral!Description: You are Pablo Escobar and you are currently under attack at La Catedral- and you’re only option is to escape through the locked tunnel entrance (by getting the key from the combination-entrenched safe) or blowing everyone up by activating the bomb.RequirementsLocked Door:In order to open the tunnel entrance, you need to use the key which is in the safe. 
Hidden Object:In order to open up the safe (so that you can get the key for the tunnel entrance) you need the hidden combination. The combination is hidden somewhere in the Game (the backdoor) and you are not told where. Thus, the user must go from location to location trying to look for or “take” the combination.Incomplete Object:In one (darker) way of going about the game, you can blow up La Catedral (and all the evidence), but the bomb needs to be activated at the front-door in order to be fully activated and destroy La Catedral. The bomb is in the safe, and the activation is at the front door.Limited Resources:You have limited times to go to the backdoor in search of the combination- every time you step into the backdoor (going from hallway w backdoor), you are “shot” and if you are shot 15 times (invincible Pablo) you die.
